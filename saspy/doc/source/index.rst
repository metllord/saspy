*************
What is this?
*************

This module provides Python APIs to the SAS system. You can start a
SAS session and run analytics from Python through a combination of
object-oriented methods or explicit SAS code submission. You can move
data between SAS data sets and Pandas dataframes and exchange values between
python vaiables and SAS macro variables. 

The APIs provide interfaces for the following:

* Start a SAS session on the same host as Python or a remote host.
* Exchange data between SAS data sets and Pandas data frames.
* Use familiar methods such as ``describe()`` and ``head()`` to work with data.

Additional functionality such as machine learning, econometrics, and quality
control are organized in Python classes.

See :doc:`getting-started` for programming examples.


************
